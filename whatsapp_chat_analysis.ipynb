Baat kare labs ki to sb se best moqa he programming proper sikhne ke liye agr koi proble he bhi to miss cooperative hain. Final labs me aap ne jo lab manual me programs kiye hote hain wohi ate hain lekin miss ne last year final lab ki jagah hum se ek project banwaya tha jo open ended lab aur final lab donu consider kiye the miss ne to aap logo ke sath bhi ye ho sakta he and worst case scenario ke aap log donu alg perform karo, open ended lab aur final lab (In donu ke marks final me count hote hain).\\n\\nFIT (Miss Simra):\\n\\nSubject mostly theoretical he, problems km hain aur problems asan he koi itni mushkil nhi. Theory me most probably definitions bhari hui hain but paper me sirf definitions nhi ati reasons etc bhi puche jate hain. Miss ka motto ye he keh jitne km alfazo me ziada baat kar sako karo even agr 1 line me bhi proper and required answer de sakte ho to de do bila wajah ziada likhne ki zaroorat nhi. FIT ki labs asan hoti hain basic si cheezein hain aur bs final lab hoti he.\\n\\nDS (Sir Shehraz):\\n\\nIsme aap ko khud mehnat karni hogi, jo topics Sir parhate hain wo us detail me nhi parhate jis detail me final me questions dete hain. Neso academy, sb milega yaha DS se related, start se hi is se parhna start kardo. Sir Shehraz ache teacher hain bs ye subject 2nd time parha rhe hain ho sakta he humme jese parhaya tha us se ziada acha parhaen aur Sir khamkha marks nhi kat te marking shi he inki.\\n\\nPS (Sir Jawad):\\n\\nBest teacher of PS, shi lilkha ho aur related likha ho topics se, Sir marks de dete hain. Baqi PS me bs pata hona chahiye ke kia, kb, kese, kyu aur kis liye hua tha baqi apni wording me jitna likh sako likho. Mids me Sir 2 questions 5,5 marks ke aur  aksr ek map dete hain jis me 10 loacations mark karni hoti hain aur Sir mids se Pehle map provide kar dete hain jis me 17-20 locations hoti hain. Final me bs 5 questions 20, 20 marks, har chapter se ek question.\\n\\nFE:\\n\\nFE me aap ko essay, paragraph, preci, letter etc likhne ke principles parhae jate hain bs wo principles ko madd-e-nazar rakhte hue english sb likhne ke liye paper me ata he. Teacher ka pata nhi kyu keh inse ab tk humne parha nhi.\\n\\nCal:\\n\\nPractice, practice, practice.\\n\\nConcepts clear hone chahiye keh agr question ko modify karke bhi aap ko dia jae to samjh aa ja keh karna kia he. Ab sawal ye he keh practice kare kese aur kaha se, yaha prati hain books. Books me kafi practice questions hote hain. 1000 ke 1000 pages parhne ki zaroorat nhi, jo topic/chapter aap ko class me parhaya jae, us hi topic/chapter ko book me dhundho aur waha practice questions mil jaenge. Sare questions solve karne ki zaroorat nhi bs itne solve karo keh concepts clear ho jae aur samjh ane lag jae keh karna kia he is type ke questions me. Aap ke calculus ke teacher ka bhi nhi pata kyu keh unho ne bhi humme nhi parhaya tha.\\n\\nYe 100% accurate nhi sb, 1 saal ho gaya in subjects ko parhe hue lekin jitna yaad tha sb bata dia.\\n\\n2 baatein aur....\\n\\n1. Ghabrana nhi he, sb aram se ho sakta he so just relax and give proper time to your studies.\\n\\n2. Hope for the best and prepare for the worst. <This message was edited>\\n',\n",
